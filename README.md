# Servo-Deploying_Model_Rocket_Code
DISCLAMER: This code is UNTESTED, there is no guarantee it will work! The program is designed to be used on a model rocket, and use IMU data from an Arduino Nano 33 BLE to detect different stages of flight. At apogee, the program rotates a servo motor to deploy the parachute. The program also stores flight data into a microSD card module.
